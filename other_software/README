Directory: /acmi/summer2014/other_software

This directory contains the source for packages that we either considered
using for our research or inspired some aspect of our research, but which
is not directly used.

./contourRelaxedSuperpixels-0.1-r2 - Source code for the contour-relaxed
				     superpixels software, which takes
				     png images and creates superpixeled
				     versions of the images.  Not used
				     because it does not have a 3D
				     implementation



/SLICSuperPixelsAndSuperVoxelsCode - Code from the original SLIC developers.
           Unfortunately this is cpp code that can only be run in windows,
	   but it still serves as a good reference to understand the algo.

/vlfeat-0.9.18 - MATLAB package of different image processing
	         softwares, The original paper describing this can be
	         found at:
	         http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/assets/pubs/vedaldi10vlfeat.pdf
