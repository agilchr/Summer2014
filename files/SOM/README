This directory contains our implementation of the pipeline desribed in
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093851#s1

This pipeline can be described as follows:
1. Obtain the ADNI dataset
2. Coregister all the images in the dataset and perform tissue segmentation
   (With SPM8)
   The most useful of these tissue segmentations is GM, followed by WM.
   Note each of the following steps in the pipeline is done using only
   one of the tissue segmentations (either GM or WM).
3. Make the difference image between AD and CN brain tissues.
4. Use SOMs to cluster the difference image (use either MATLAB's native SOM
   or the somtoolbox)
5. Calculate the FDR for the dataset
6. Cluster each brain in the dataset based on the SOM clustering of the
   difference image.
7. Calculate the "relative importance" value of each cluster in each brain
   by summing the intensities of the voxels in each cluster multiplied by
   the FDR of that coordinate.
8. Use SVMs to classify images based on the relative importances of their
   clusters.
