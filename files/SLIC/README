This directory contains the code for our implementation of the SLIC algorithm
for use with .nii (3D) files, for which we could not find a ready-made
software package.  For comparison purposes, we also implemented our algorithm
for use with 2D images.

./SLIC_2D.m - Our SLIC implementation for use with 2D images, largely inspired
	      by the implementation from the software in
	      /sonigroup/summer2014/tgelles1/brainseg2014/other_software/SLICSuperpixelsAndSupervoxelsCode/SLICSuperpixels/SLIC.cpp.
	      This file is run using ./runSLIC_2D.m
	      

./SLIC_2DExact.m - An slight alternative SLIC implementation that uses
		   exactly the number of superpixels specified, where
		   the original code will use a different number to
		   better fit the image.  However, the exact code is
		   limited to only a few such possible numbers.  This
		   was written to make sure every segmented brain
		   image had the same amount of data associated with
		   it.
		   This file is run using ./runSLIC_2DExact.m

./SLIC_3D.m - Our implementation of the SLIC algorithm for use with
	      .nii files.
	      This file is run using ./runSLIC_3D.m

./SLIC_3DExact.m - Our implementation of the SLIC algorithm for use
	      	   with .nii files, that uses exactly the number of supervoxels
		   specified.  
		   This file is run using ./runSLIC_3DExact.m

./cropBlack.m - A script to remove the black margins around brain
	      	images in .nii files.  These black margins interfere
	      	with the accuracy of our SLIC implementation.


./entropySurface.m - Code for making a graphic from the results of the
		     ./testEntropy.m scripts that more easily displays
		     which combination of parameters yields the lowest
		     supervoxel entropy (the parameters being number of
		     supervoxels and the shape parameter)

./getSLICFeatures.m - A script to obtain different brain "features" or
		      statistics of the brain based on SLIC and the
		      tissue segmentation.

./getTissueInfo.m - Code for obtaining information about the
		    distribution of tissue types throughout the SLIC
		    supervoxels.

./runSLIC.m - The main interface we used for running the SLIC
	      algorithm and getting relevant features.  This script
	      organizes the inputs and usage of the SLIC_3D and
	      getSLICFeatures programs.

./runSLIC2D.m - Small wrapper around SLIC_2D.m, much less comprehensive than
	      	runSLIC.m.

./runSLIC2DExact.m - Identical to runSLIC2D.m

./runSLICExact.m - Identical to runSLIC.m

./testEntropy.m - Script to run many iterations of SLIC with different
		  parameters and compare the per-voxel entropies for each
		  run, with the goal of finding the ideal parameters by
		  minimizing entropy.
