Directory: /acmi/summer2014

This directory contains the code, scripts, and images relevant to our brain
imaging research over the summer.  More general resources are located in
/acmi



Directory Listing:

./files - Matlab scripts for tissue segmentation processing

./UGM - MATLAB library for doing some of the primary functionality of
       our main code. This is the code that we have edited (somewhat)
       for functionality, efficiency, or appearance. The original code
       can be found online and slightly modified code can be found in
       the /acmi/chris13/UGM directory	    

./other_software - packages that were either considered for use in our
		   project or inspired aspects of our project, but are
		   not directly used.

./SPM_Notes.txt - Notes from Chris Magnano's explanation of his 2013 research
