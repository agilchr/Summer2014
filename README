Directory: /acmi/summer2014

This directory contains the code, scripts, and images relevant to our brain
imaging research over the summer.  More general resources are located in
/acmi



Directory Listing:

./scripts - Matlab scripts for tissue segmentation processing
	    Currently mostly a copy of the work done by Christopher
	    Magnano

./UGM - Source code for the UGM segmentation software package, which contains
      	the CRF utilities used for research

./contourRelaxedSuperpixels-0.1-r2 - Source code for the contour-relaxed
				     superpixels software, which takes
				     png images and creates superpixeled
				     versions of the images

/UGM - MATLAB library for doing some of the primary functionality of our main
       code. This is the code that we have edited (somewhat) for functionality,
       efficiency, or appearance. The original code can be found online and
       slightly modified code can be found in the /acmi/chris13/UGM directory

/SLICSuperPixelsAndSuperVoxelsCode - Code from the original SLIC developers.
           Unfortunately this is cpp code that can only be run in windows,
	   but it still serves as a good reference to understand the algo.

/vlfeat-0.9.18 - MATLAB package of different image processing
	         softwares, The original paper describing this can be
	         found at:
	         http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/assets/pubs/vedaldi10vlfeat.pdf
