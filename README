Directory: /acmi/summer2014

This directory contains the code, scripts, and images relevant to our brain
imaging research over the summer.  More general resources are located in
/acmi



Directory Listing:

/scripts - Matlab scripts for tissue segmentation processing
	   Currently mostly a copy of the work done by Christopher Magnano
	   from Summer 2013, though most non-useful code is stored in the
	   legacy directory

/UGM - MATLAB library for doing some of the primary functionality of our main
       code. This is the code that we have edited (somewhat) for functionality,
       efficiency, or appearance. The original code can be found online and
       slightly modified code can be found in the /acmi/chris13/UGM directory

/SLICSuperPixelsAndSuperVoxelsCode - Code from the original SLIC developers.
           Unfortunately this is cpp code that can only be run in windows,
	   but it still serves as a good reference to understand the algo.

/contourRelaxedSuperpixels-0.1-r2 - Competing code to SLIC; runs on its own but
           at the time is not configurable with MATLAB.

/vlfeat-0.9.18 - MATLAB package of different image processing softwares,
	         The original paper describing this can be found at:
