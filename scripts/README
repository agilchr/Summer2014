Directory: /sonigroup/summer2014/tgelles1/brainseg2014/scripts

This directory contains the main code and scripts used for our brain
imaging resource that we wrote ourselves as subdirectories.  Ready-made
packages that we obtained from other sources are in ../other_software


Directory Listing:

./CRF - Code for running tissue segmentation, using Chris Magnano's work
      	from 2013

./SLIC - Our implementation of the SLIC superpixelation algorithm for
       	 use with .nii files.  All superpixel implementations we could
       	 find either worked solely in pixels, rather than voxels as
       	 our .nii files come in, or do not run on linux.  This code
       	 fixes both these problems.

./SVM - Code for predicting AD/MCI/CN diagnosis using the features generated
      	from the superpixels we created

./SpectralClustering - Code for using the Spectral Clustering grouping
		       technique on the features generated from the
		       superpixels we created

./condor - Condor files, bash scripts the condor files use, and copies
	   of scripts that are called by the bash scripts to make sure
	   we do not edit files that are in-use.

./debug - Custom debugging code for MATLAB use

./legacy - Code from Chris Magnano's work last summer and some code from
	   this summer that is no longer in use for our pipeline

./scripts - Miscellaneous scripts that we useful for self-contained tasks
