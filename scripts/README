Directory: /acmi/summer2014/tgelles1/brainseg2014/scripts

This directory contains the main code and scripts used for our brain
imaging resource that we wrote ourselves.  The UGM package, which our
code relies on but which we did not write, is in a separate directory.


Directory Listing:

./CRF_fastTune.m - Code for running tissue segmentation using CRFs.
		   The purpose of this file is to find the optimal
		   number of iterations to run CRF_test with.  Largely
		   a prettified copy of Chris Magnano's work from 2013

./CRF_test.m - Code for running tissue segmentation using CRFs.  This
	       is the main learning scripts, where the CRF is actually
	       trained to recognize tissue types.  Largely a
	       prettified copy of Chris Magnano's work from 2013

./SLIC_3D.m - Our implementation of the SLIC algorithm for use with
	      .nii files.  All superpixel implementations we could
	      find either worked solely in pixels, rather than voxels
	      as our .nii files come in, or do not run on linux.  This
	      code fixes both these problems.

./compareSLIC.m - A short scripts to just call runSLIC a few times and
		  see the results.

./cropBlack.m - A script to remove the black margins around brain
	      	images in .nii files.  These black margins interfere
	      	with the accuracy of our SLIC implementation.

./getSLICFeatures.m - A script to obtain different brain "features" or
		      statistics of the brain based on SLIC and the
		      tissue segmentation.

./getTissueInfo.m - Code for obtaining information about the
		    distribution of tissue types throughout the SLIC
		    supervoxels.

./runSLIC.m - The main interface we used for running the SLIC
	      algorithm and getting relevant features.  This scripts
	      organizes the inputs and usage of the SLIC_3D and
	      getSLICFeatures programs.
