This directory contains the code for brain tissue segmentation into
either White Matter, Grey Matter, or Cerebral Spinal Fluid.  This is mostly
a copy of Chris Magnano's work from summer 2013.


Directory Listing:

./CRF_fastTune.m - Code for running tissue segmentation using CRFs.
		   The purpose of this file is to find the optimal
		   number of iterations to run CRF_test with.

./CRF_test.m - Code for running tissue segmentation using CRFs.  This
	       is the main learning scripts, where the CRF is actually
	       trained to recognize tissue types.  Uses 5-fold cross
	       validation as a way to create sets for training and for testing.

./CRF_train.m - Similar to CRF_test, except is mean for the sole purpose of
	      	training a CRF rather than training and testing a CRF.  Thus,
		large sections of CRF_test have been removed, and 5-fold cross
		validation is no longer necessary.
